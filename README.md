### Motivation:
#### The time we spend away from our families can be paramount for individual evolution or finding out who we really are. During that time it can be difficult to maintain contact with those who we've known our whole lives especially when every popular app out there is about making new connections with strangers. 

#### There's no shame in the fact that our brains often loosen their grips on the past to make room for new relationships. But the reason for MY app, is to re-invigorate the bonds we have with our immediate families.
